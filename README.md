# Advent of Code 2024 🎄✨

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I’ll be tackling the daily programming puzzles of this year's event.

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event featuring an advent calendar of **small programming puzzles** for programmers of all skill levels. Each day from **December 1st to December 25th**, a new puzzle is unlocked, and participants can solve them in any programming language they prefer.

People participate in Advent of Code for various reasons:
- Interview preparation
- Company training
- University coursework
- General programming practice
- Speed contests or friendly challenges

## Goals of This Repository
- Solve puzzles daily and share solutions.
- Improve problem-solving and coding skills.
- Experiment with new techniques and features in my programming toolkit.
- Have fun while keeping the holiday spirit alive! 🎅🎁

## Solutions
Each puzzle's solution is implemented in the corresponding day folder, e.g., `day-1/` for **Day 1**. Solutions will include:
1. Puzzle input
2. Code implementation.
3. A brief explanation of the approach, if applicable.

### Languages and Tools
I'll be primarily using **Ruby**, but I might explore others as part of the learning process.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```
2. Navigate to the day's puzzle directory, e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd day-1
   ```
3. Run the code using the respective language’s instructions.
